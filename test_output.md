The plot of inhibitor concentration over degree of surface coverage versus inhibitor concentration
gives a straight line as shown in Fig. 5. The strong correlation reveals that egg shell adsorption on
stainless surface in 0.5 M H2SO4 follow Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Figs. 6–8 show the SEM/EDX
surface morphology analysis of stainless steel. Figs. 7 and 8 are the SEM/EDX images of the stainless
steel specimens without and with inhibitor after weight loss experiment in sulphuric acid medium.
The stainless steel surface corrosion product layer in the absence of inhibitor was porous and as a
result gives no corrosion protection. With the presence of ES, corrosion damage was minimized, with
an evidence of ES present on the metal surface as shown in Fig. 8.
