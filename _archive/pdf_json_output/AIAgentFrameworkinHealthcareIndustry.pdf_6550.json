Luci is the first AI-based medical agent designed to automate a wide range of healthcare processes. LUCI will also be very suitable for medical scribing, as its voice agent simplifies the creation of clinical notes. The chain-of- thought mechanism introduced in this framework allows the user to pass multiple prompts in a go for the model to serve different functionalities. As an example, one prompt can be used for searching medical data, and another for writing. This is an innovative way that will revolutionize the field. Moreover, LUCI applies RxNorms to ensure consistency in medical nomenclature, which makes functionality even more effective.",

All the medical AI is dependent on any AI agent, However, while many AI solutions exist in healthcare, there remains a significant gap: the lack of a comprehensive AI agent framework tailored specifically for healthcare developers[2]. Traditional AI frameworks are often too generic or limited, failing to meet the unique requirements of healthcare data, regulations, and practices. Developers are often forced to build their solutions from scratch or heavily modify existing frameworks, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. To solve the problems of health care developers, we introduce Luci\u2014 learning useful clinical intelligence\u2014the first medical AI[3] agent that will change the world. It is incorporated with the advanced medical search[4] feature and chain of thoughts where the user can give multiple prompts, and each prompt will have a unique tool like search, review, and others. Developers can also use multiple prompts and build the agent, as well as users can choose tools for the prompt. In the Luci-agent building section, the user can give objectives, tasks, and precautions and mention tools. One agent can be connected to another agent. Here we make it unique that agents can process tasks perfectly and pass the data to another agent with a unique tool or our own-made tool by creating a streamlined process, and the final output will be so optimized and updated as per the recent knowledge.",

        "text": "The rapid adoption of AI in healthcare has sparked numerous research initiatives aimed at developing specialized frameworks. Existing frameworks, like the one proposed by IEEE Access[5] for smart health, demonstrate the potential for AI to handle complex medical procedures, data analysis, and patient care. However, the need for an AI agent framework specific to healthcare remains unmet. This gap becomes particularly evident in areas such as real-time medical decision[6] support, advanced medical coding, and the processing of patient data for clinical notes. Luci represents the first AI medical agent framework designed to address these critical healthcare needs. Unlike existing AI tools, which tend to focus on isolated functions, Luci integrates a holistic approach where multiple agents[7] can collaborate and communicate seamlessly. This multi-agent architecture enhances clinical decision- making by utilizing chain-of-thought[8] processes, advanced search capabilities, and custom tools designed specifically for healthcare professionals and developers. Each agent is customizable, allowing developers to define objectives and tasks tailored to specific medical contexts. Developers can create agents equipped with unique tools for specific healthcare-related tasks. Luci handles multiple prompts by breaking down complex queries and selecting appropriate tools for each stage of the process. Luci agents can communicate and collaborate with each other, providing a collaborative ecosystem that enhances performance in tasks such as medical scribing, coding using RxNorm[9], and clinical decision-making. By deploying Luci in healthcare environments, the framework can automate intricate tasks that typically require manual intervention. Evaluations of Luci\u2019s performance in clinical coding and medical decision-making have shown promising results, with improved accuracy in diagnosis support and efficiency in data processing. These results underscore the transformative potential of AI agent frameworks in healthcare, paving the way for intelligent, autonomous systems that can assist both developers and healthcare professionals. This refined structure aligns with the writing and formatting standards required by platforms like IEEE, ensuring your paper is well-received by technical reviewers. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has revolutionized the way medical processes are handled, from diagnostics to patient data management. AI agents, designed to automate complex decision-making, have proven particularly valuable in addressing healthcare\u2019s intricate challenges. Despite the progress in AI-driven healthcare tools, a major limitation is the lack of a comprehensive framework that allows developers to customize agents for specific healthcare tasks, such as clinical decision support, medical coding, and patient record management. Research shows that while there are generalized AI frameworks, such as multi-agent systems in various industries, few are designed to handle the highly regulated and data-sensitive healthcare environment. Current tools often focus on limited functions like diagnostic assistance or medical imaging analysis, but do not provide the level of adaptability and collaboration required for complex, evolving healthcare systems. This gap highlights the necessity for a framework like Luci, which offers a customizable, agent-based AI system that healthcare developers can utilize for creating tailored solutions. Luci not only integrates advanced search and chain-of-thought mechanisms but also enables the use of specialized tools to tackle the nuanced requirements of the healthcare domain. By allowing agents to communicate and collaborate, Luci fosters an ecosystem where tasks such as medical decision-making, advanced coding (e.g., RxNorm), and clinical notes management are streamlined. As healthcare increasingly relies on AI for efficient and precise operations, the demand for adaptable AI agents will continue to grow. Luci's framework aims to fill this gap by offering healthcare professionals a robust, developer-friendly platform that enhances efficiency and accuracy in medical processes.",
